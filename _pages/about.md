I'm an actuarial analyst with a passion for data analytics. I have experience working with advanced data manipulation, machine learning, and data visualization. I have worked on data projects for Microsoft and for the Society of Actuaries. When I'm not studying for actuarial exams, I enjoy working on data science projects, hiking, snowboarding, and watching TV shows like "Seinfeld". I have a passion for data analytics, following financial markets, and tech.
