I'm an actuarial analyst working in the health industry. Through work and other projects, I have developed skills in machine learning, data visualization, financial forcasting, and trend analysis. I have worked on projects for Microsoft and for the Society of Actuaries. When I'm not studying for actuarial exams, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, photography, and watching TV shows like Seinfeld.
