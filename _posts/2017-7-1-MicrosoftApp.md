<h3>Microsoft Program Usage Analysis</h3>

Over the summer of 2017, I worked for a data analytics company, Jonathan Tooley Associates, located in Portugal. While there, I worked with a team to prepare a presentation that won a project bid from Microsoft. The task was to analyze program usage data collected from various companies. 

Using Excel, R, and Shiny I built an interactive data dashboard to explore the data. The dashboard features interactive bar charts, regression analysis, clustering algorithms, apriori association rules analysis, and linear discriminent analysis. 

My data dashboard as well as other analyses done by my colleagues were presented to the client, Microsoft. The link to the web application I created is below. The program names are hidden for confidentiality reasons.
