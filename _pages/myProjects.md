<h3>Auto Insurance Forecast</h3>

The Society of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuarial Society hired students from my university to create aggregate reports of auto insurance data. I worked with a few other students to analyze several auto insurance metrics accross each of the 50 US States. In November, 2018 we traveled to Las Vegas to report our findings at the Casualty Actuarial Society Annual Conference.

I prepared the trends report in which I used ARIMA models to forecast auto insurance metrics. The report points out which states had out of the ordinary values based on the ARIMA model. The report I created is the "Auto Loss Cost Trends Q4 2017"

<h3>Program Usage Analysis for Microsoft</h3>

Over the summer of 2017, I interned for a data analytics company, Jonathan Tooley Associates, located in Portugal. While there, I worked with a team to prepare a presentation to Microsoft to win a project bid. The task was to analyze program usage data from various companies. 

Using Excel, R, and Shiny I built an interactive data dashboard to explore the data. The web dashboard features interactive bar charts, regression analysis, clustering algorithms, an apriori association rules analysis, and linear discriminent analysis. 

My web dashboard and other analyses by other employees were presented to the client, Microsoft, and won the project bid. The link to the web application I created is below. The program names are hidden for confidentiality reasons.

<h5>Financial data project</h5>

Using web scrapping and other API tools, I built a data dashboard to easily access financial information in one place. The dashboard features an interactive candlestick stock chart, company financials, GDP plots for hundreds of countries, US Treasury bond yield graphs, and a FOREX table that updates every second.
