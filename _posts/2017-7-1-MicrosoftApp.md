<h3>Microsoft Program Usage Analysis</h3>

Over the summer of 2017, I interned for a data analytics company, Jonathan Tooley Associates, located in Portugal. While there, I worked with a team to prepare a presentation to win a project bid with Microsoft. The task was to analyze program usage data from various companies. 

Using Excel, R, and Shiny I built an interactive data dashboard to explore the data. The web dashboard features interactive bar charts, regression analysis, clustering algorithms, an apriori association rules analysis, and linear discriminent analysis. 

My web dashboard and other analyses by other employees were presented to the client, Microsoft, and won the project bid. The link to the web application I created is below. The program names are hidden for confidentiality reasons.
