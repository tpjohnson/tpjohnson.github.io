<h3>Auto Insurance Forecast for the SOA and CAS</h3>

The Society of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuarial Society hired students from my university to create aggregate reports using US auto insurance data. I prepared the trends report in which I used ARIMA models to forecast auto insurance metrics across each of the 50 US states. Using time series analysis I found the states with out of the ordinary metrics that could be explained by outside variables.

These findings are published on the Society of Actuaries' website. We also presented our work to 100+ actuaries at the Casualty Actuarial Society's annual conference in Las Vegas in 2018. I created the report titled, "Auto Loss Cost Trends Q4 2017" on the SOA's site.

<h3>Program Usage Analysis for Microsoft</h3>

Over the summer of 2017, I interned for a data analytics company, Jonathan Tooley Associates, located in Portugal. While there, I worked with a team to prepare a presentation to win a project bid with Microsoft. The task was to analyze program usage data from various companies. 

Using Excel, R, and Shiny I built an interactive data dashboard to explore the data. The web dashboard features interactive bar charts, regression analysis, clustering algorithms, an apriori association rules analysis, and linear discriminent analysis. 

My web dashboard and other analyses by other employees were presented to the client, Microsoft, and won the project bid. The link to the web application I created is below. The program names are hidden for confidentiality reasons.

<h5>Financial data project</h5>

Using web scrapping and other API tools, I built a data dashboard to easily access financial information. The dashboard features an interactive candlestick stock chart, company financials, GDP plots for hundreds of countries, US Treasury bond yield graphs, and a FOREX table that updates every second.
