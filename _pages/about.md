I'm an actuarial analyst with a passion for data analytics. I have experience working with machine learning, data visualization, and financial forcasting. I have worked on data projects for Microsoft and for the Society of Actuaries. When I'm not studying for actuarial exams, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and watching TV shows like "Seinfeld". I have a passion for data, following financial markets, and tech.
