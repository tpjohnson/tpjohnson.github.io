I'm an actuarial analyst working in the health industry. I have experience working with machine learning, data visualization, and financial forcasting. I have worked on projects for Microsoft and for the Society of Actuaries. When I'm not studying for actuarial exams, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, photography, and watching TV shows like Seinfeld.
