<h3>Auto Insurance Forecast for the SOA and CAS</h3>

The Society of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuarial Society hired students from my university to create aggregate reports using US auto insurance data. I prepared the trends report in which I used ARIMA models to forecast auto insurance metrics across each of the 50 US states. Using time series analysis I found the states with out of the ordinary metrics that could be explained by outside variables.

These findings are published on the Society of Actuaries' website. We also presented our work to 100+ actuaries at the Casualty Actuarial Society's annual conference in Las Vegas in 2018. I created the report titled, "Auto Loss Cost Trends Q4 2017" on the SOA's site.
